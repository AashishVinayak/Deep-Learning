# Deep Dream

This is Deep Dream! A fun project to visualize how a neural network dreams. The idea is to take a trained CNN (Inception in this case) and till a certain hidden layer calculate the gradients of that layerâ€™s activation function and backpropagate, apply Gradient Ascent to maximize the activation function of that layer and update the image by adding those gradients to it.
