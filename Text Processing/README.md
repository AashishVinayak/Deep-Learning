# Text Processing

This is an example of how we can clean the text by using techniques such as removing stop-words, stemming & lemmatization, regular expressions etc. Cleaning the text is necessary as it filters out unnecessary stuff which might hide the useful information that the algorithm needs.

Also, there are examples of how Skip-Gram algorithm can be used for creating word vectors to feed into the neural networks. There are two notebooks, one of them demonstrates how word embeddings are trained using Keras and the other one is a high level implementation of skip-gram using Gensim Library.
