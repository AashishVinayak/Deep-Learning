# Image Classification

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32Ã—32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. I have trained a Convolution Neural Network using both Tensorflow and Keras using Adam Optimizer and Softmax cross entropy.
